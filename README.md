Audio Link

Audiolink is a spotify playlist building application. The inital code for this app
came from a CodeAcademy project. The purpose of the project was to practice retreiving 
search data from a public API and passing data between react components using state and props. 

Throughout the project the main components were added and written by me. Later syling changes were made.

The project is currently experiecing issues with facebook sign-in, please sign in manually if possible.
